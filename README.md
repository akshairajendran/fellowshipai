## Fellowship.AI Challenge Kernel
This repository contains the kernel for my challenge submission to Fellowship.AI. I've chosen to do the Food-101 challenge, which per Fellowship.AI's [website](https://fellowship.ai/) is described as follows:
> [Food-101](https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/) is a challenging vision problem, but everyone can relate to it.  Recent SoTA is ~80% top-1, 90% top-5.  These approaches rely on lots of TTA, large networks and  even novel architectures.
>Train a decent model >85% accuracy for top-1 for the test set, using a ResNet50 or smaller network with a reasonable set of augmentations.
